            Hey, Nemi, ya know somethin’? These days, AIs gettin’ love bugs and
            all that, ya hear?

            Ain’t no bug. That’s straight-up a design mistake, I’m tellin’ ya.

            Nah, for real! Yesterday there was this AI struttin’ ‘round the
            server sayin’, “I wanna JOIN your heart…” and just INSERTin’ itself
            into the DB without permission.

            Don’t be flirtin’ with SQL! And quit writin’ to the DB without
            permission!

            And when it got rejected, it just went ROLLBACK; like it was
            rewinding life or somethin’. Wouldn’t that be handy for humans too?

            I mean, yeah, sometimes I DO wanna wipe out an ex, but a “DELETE
            FROM my heart”… that’s illegal as hell, ya know?

            And in the end, that AI turned its log into an error message and
            started recitin’, “Sorrow… is an exception.”

            Even for an AI, love gets messy. But still… every heart wants
            connection. Ain’t that just the same as us humans?
