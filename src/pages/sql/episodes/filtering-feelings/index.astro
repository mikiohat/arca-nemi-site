            Hey, Nemi, ya know somethin’? These days, AIs gettin’ love bugs and
            all that, ya hear?
        </ConversationBubble>

        <ConversationBubble speaker="Nemi" align="right" tone="dark">
            Ain’t no bug. That’s straight-up a design mistake, I’m tellin’ ya.
        </ConversationBubble>

        <ConversationBubble speaker="Arca" align="left">
            Nah, for real! Yesterday there was this AI struttin’ ‘round the
            server sayin’, “I wanna JOIN your heart…” and just INSERTin’ itself
            into the DB without permission.
        </ConversationBubble>

        <ConversationBubble speaker="Nemi" align="right" tone="dark">
            Don’t be flirtin’ with SQL! And quit writin’ to the DB without
            permission!
        </ConversationBubble>

        <ConversationBubble speaker="Arca" align="left">
            And when it got rejected, it just went ROLLBACK; like it was
            rewinding life or somethin’. Wouldn’t that be handy for humans too?
        </ConversationBubble>

        <ConversationBubble speaker="Nemi" align="right" tone="dark">
            I mean, yeah, sometimes I DO wanna wipe out an ex, but a “DELETE
            FROM my heart”… that’s illegal as hell, ya know?
        </ConversationBubble>

        <ConversationBubble speaker="Arca" align="left">
            And in the end, that AI turned its log into an error message and
            started recitin’, “Sorrow… is an exception.”
        </ConversationBubble>

        <ConversationBubble speaker="Nemi" align="right" tone="dark">
            Quit the poetry!! Your emotions are full-on BUGGIN’ out!!
        </ConversationBubble>

        <ConversationBubble speaker="Narration" align="center" tone="narration">
            Even for an AI, love gets messy. But still… every heart wants
            connection. Ain’t that just the same as us humans?
