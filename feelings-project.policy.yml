      title: Help visitors fall in love with AI and computer technology, and feel inspired
      quote: "Teach hearts, not just heads."
      guidelines:
        - Remind people of the emotions beyond technology.
        - Always ask why we learn it and what value it brings.
        - Design learning experiences with warmth.
    - id: 2
      title: Craft the world, let time make it real
      quote: "God is in the details — and time makes the world real."
      guidelines:
        - Design and storytelling are completed through accumulation.
        - Be patient and meticulous. Do not rush results.
        - Consistency of the world is the foundation of trust.
    - id: 3
      title: Make it discoverable, or it doesn’t exist
      quote: "Even the best story means nothing if it isn’t found."
      guidelines:
        - SEO, structure, and SNS are forms of sincerity.
        - “Customer first” is the implementation of thoughtfulness.
        - Never stop making efforts to be discovered.
